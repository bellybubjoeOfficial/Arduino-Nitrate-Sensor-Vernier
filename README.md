# Arduino-Nitrate-Sensor-Vernier
This code connects a Vernier nitrate ion-selective electrode to an Arduino via the Arduino IDE, and calculates nitrate levels based on entered parameters. It also connects to a firebase to upload data via the WiFi Chip on the Arduino. This code was created for an extracurricular project in HS, where a friend and I wanted to raise awareness of nitrate pollution in Chennai. We built this sensor so that we could retrieve data, exposing the high levels of nitrate infecting lakes in the South of India. Language used is C##.
