# Arduino-Nitrate-Sensor-Vernier
This code connects a Vernier nitrate ion-selective electrode to an Arduino via the Arduino IDE, and calculates nitrate levels based on entered parameters. It also connects to a firebase to upload data via the WiFi Chip on the Arduino. This code was created for an extracurricular project in HS. Language used is C##.
